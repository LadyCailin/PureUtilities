/**
 * This class provides a generic way to have a threadsafe map of singleton values, where a key maps to a single value,
 * and where the value is only created if it doesn't exist and only once.
 *
 * There is a decent amount of complexity involved in this task, and so this class wraps the functionality. The class
 * extends Map, so it can generally be used in place of other Map objects.
 *
 * Insertions will trigger synchronization, but given it is a singleton pool, this is assumed to not happen frequently.
 * The put and remove methods will trigger an exception if they are called. Only the internal generator is allowed to
 * insert values into the internal map, and values are not allowed to be removed.

	/*
	 * You might notice that no fields in this class are volatile. Normally, when you double lock, you must do
	 * something like this to be totally correct:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * volatile Object value = null; // Note the volatility
	 * construct() {
	 *	Object result = value;
	 *	if(result == null) {
	 *		synchronized(result) {
	 *		if(result == null) {
	 *			result = new Object();
	 *			value = result;
	 *		}
	 *		}
	 *	}
	 *	return result;
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * Note that we are doing the double locking per usual, but the value is volatile. The local result value seems
	 * unnecessary at first, but the effect of this is that in cases where value is already initialized
	 * (i.e., most of the time), the volatile field is only accessed once (due to "return result;" instead of
	 * "return value;"), which can improve the method's overall performance by as much as 25 percent.
	 *
	 * However, in the case that we have before us, the ConcurrentHashMap handles this for us, by guaranteeing that
	 * we never get a value that is partially constructed in the get() method.
