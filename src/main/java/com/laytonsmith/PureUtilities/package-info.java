/**
 * This packages contains classes that are very generic utilities. There
 * are no project specific dependencies in any of these classes, however they may
 * depend on other classes within this package. This makes them highly portable
 * to other projects. Dependencies amongst other classes within the package is
 * also kept to a minimum, so in many cases, single files may be copied over into
 * another project.
 *
 * In a few cases, the files have dependencies on external libraries, and serve more
 * as a wrapper around other utilities, rather than actual standalone utilities.
